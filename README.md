## Overview

The Unified Knowledge Management System is designed to aggregate, process, and unify knowledge from various sources, making it accessible through standardized interfaces. This system bridges the gap between different knowledge repositories, creating a seamless experience for both users and AI assistants.

By combining vector search, knowledge graphs, and traditional document storage, our system provides comprehensive knowledge retrieval with high relevance and context awareness.

## Architecture

The system is built around a six-layer architecture, each handling specific aspects of knowledge management:

## Components

### Web Content Acquisition

- **DevDocs**: Free and open-source documentation crawler with 364 GitHub stars, capable of processing up to 1000 pages/minute
- **Firecrawl**: Commercial web crawler ($16/month) handling general web content at approximately 20 pages/minute

### Knowledge Processing

- **Text Chunking**: Divides documents into 512 token chunks with 50 token overlap
- **Vector Embedding**: Creates semantic representations using Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies entities and relationships for knowledge graph construction

### Knowledge Storage

- **Structured Documents Store**: Preserves original documents with metadata in JSON/Markdown format
- **Qdrant Vector Database**: High-performance vector similarity search (626 QPS at 99.5% recall)
- **Knowledge Graph Database**: Stores entities and their relationships for graph-based queries
- **Obsidian Vault**: Manages personal knowledge with bidirectional linking

### MCP Server Layer

- **DevDocs MCP**: Exposes technical documentation via stdio transport
- **Firecrawl MCP**: Exposes web content via HTTP+SSE transport
- **Qdrant MCP**: Provides vector search capabilities via stdio transport
- **Knowledge Graph MCP**: Enables graph-based queries via stdio transport

### Integration Layer

- **Unified Search Engine**: Combines and ranks results from multiple knowledge sources
- **Supergateway**: Handles protocol conversion (stdio↔SSE) and client connection

### Client Layer

- **Claude Desktop**: AI assistant with unified knowledge access
- **Cursor**: AI-enhanced code editor with knowledge integration
- **Roo Code**: AI coding assistant leveraging unified knowledge
